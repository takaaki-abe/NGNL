# NGNL(NO GAME NO LIFE)

NGNL is Flutter minimal game engine!!  
  
I tested two devices.  
Low resolution devices may have display problems.  
Sorry my works only in Portrait mode. It does not work in Landscape mode.  

- HUAWEI nova lite 2  
OS: Android OS 8.0  
Screen density:2160x1080  

- iPhone 7  
OS: iOS 12.0  
Screen density:1334x750

I’m an old gamer.  
I learned programming on an 8bit computer to create the game.  
Flutter is very exciting. The 5KB code worked correctly on iOS and Android.  
I’m very grateful to the Flutter team. Thank you so much!
